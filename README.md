# StaffRecords Database

## Description


## Installation


## Usage


## Tests
 1. Started by making a simple inquirer prompt function that console logged the choosen action.
 2. Seeded the tables and created a function called "selectTable" that selects the choosen table from the database and displays it in the console. To test, I added the function in the prompt function where the user chooses to view the tables.
 3. Created a function called "addNew" that adds a new value to the selected table by prompting the user for input. To test the function I added the function in the prompt function where the user chose to add a new value to a table and added test values into each table.
 4. Created a function called "deleteValueFrom" that prompts the user to choose a value to delete from their choosen table. Tested by putting the function inside the "promptUser" function and deleting the test values used in bullet three.
